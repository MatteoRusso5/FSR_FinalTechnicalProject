# Trajectory Tracking for Quadrotors under External Wrenches: Hierarchical vs Passivity-Based Control


This repository presents the implementation and comparison of two control architectures for a quadrotor UAV:

- Hierarchical Control: based on a two-loop structure with an outer LQR controller for position and an inner PD controller for attitude.
- Passivity-Based Control: For robust stability.

Both control strategies are tested in two scenarios:
- Without external disturbances
- With external disturbances (external wrench)


## ðŸ›  Requirements

- MATLAB R2024a or newer  
- Simulink  
- Control System Toolbox
- Signal Processing Toolbox
- UAV Toolbox

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Navigate to the desired controller folder (Hierarchical/ or Passivity/).
3. Run one of the simulation scripts:
   ### Hierarchical Control:
   
   run('main.m')           % without disturbance  
   run('main_wrench.m')    % with external disturbance
   
   ### Passivity-Based Control:
   
   run('MainPassivityNoDisturbance.m')     % without disturbance  
   run('MainPassivityDisturbance.m')       % with external disturbance  
   

## ðŸ“Š Simulation Outputs

Each simulation automatically generates the following:

- ðŸ›¸ 3D UAV animation during the execution of the trajectory tracking.
- ðŸ“ˆ Plots showing:
  - Reference trajectory
  - Position tracking 
  - Orientation tracking 
  - Control errors and stability behavior
- ðŸ’¾ EPS files containing all plots, will be saved in the corresponding subfolder for documentation and report inclusion.
